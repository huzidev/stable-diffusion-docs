Models trained on 2.1 needs a yaml file 

Procedure
- https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion/tree/main/configs/stable-diffusion
- v2-inference-v.yaml for 2.1 768 model
- v2-inference.yaml for 2.1 512 model
- just download this single time and any model trained on 2.1 model can use them just rename that yaml file exact as of that model's name

Ex: 
- illuminatiDiffusionV2.1.safetensors is trained on 2.1 model so the yaml file will be illuminatiDiffusionV2.1.yaml
- realismEngine_v2.1.safetensors is trained on 2.1 model so the yaml file will be realismEngine_v2.1.yaml
- make sure to put the yaml file at the same folder as of models.
